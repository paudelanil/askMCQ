        "question": "A 45-year-old patient, Ms. Roberts, presents with a history of moderate persistent asthma. She has been on medium-dose inhaled corticosteroids (ICS) and a long-acting beta2-agonist (LABA) for the past year. Her symptoms are well controlled most of the time, but she experiences worsening symptoms during seasonal changes. She is interested in learning about additional measures to reduce seasonal exacerbations. Ms. Roberts has no history of smoking, and spirometry shows moderate obstruction with significant reversibility. Allergy testing reveals sensitization to dust mites and pollen. What would be the most appropriate next step in her management to address her seasonal exacerbations?",

The child's parent reports that the wheezing episodes have been occurring approximately every 2-3 months, significantly disrupting the child's sleep and daily activities. The child's current treatment consists of a short-acting beta2-agonist (SABA) for symptom relief as needed. Based on the guidelines provided, which of the following is the MOST appropriate next step in managing this child's asthma, considering both the potential benefits and harms of the treatment?",

This approach is supported by evidence showing a **33% relative risk reduction in exacerbations requiring systemic corticosteroids** compared to SABA alone [1]. While daily ICS is another option, the guidelines support the use of intermittent ICS specifically for this clinical scenario in this age group.

The patient reports that they continue to experience occasional asthma exacerbations, especially when exposed to known indoor allergens. Their most recent Asthma Control Test (ACT) score is 20, and spirometry shows mild obstruction. A Fractional Exhaled Nitric Oxide (FeNO) test is considered, and the patient expresses concerns about the implications of the test result on treatment decisions.

The guidelines state that **FeNO should be part of an ongoing asthma management strategy that includes frequent assessments** to prevent exacerbations. It's also important to note that FeNO levels may be affected by other conditions and that **no evidence-based FeNO cutpoints are available for choosing, monitoring, or adjusting anti-inflammatory therapies** [3, 4]. Therefore FeNO measurements should be interpreted in conjunction with other clinical data and not used as a standalone determinant of treatment adjustments [4].",

While the guidelines note that LAMAs may reduce exacerbations compared to placebo [6], they also indicate that adding a LAMA to an ICS-LABA combination is not favored [7]. **Bronchial Thermoplasty (BT) should only be considered after other treatment options have been evaluated** [8] and SCIT is indicated for allergic asthma.

This approach is more effective than single-component interventions [13]. **Impermeable pillow and mattress covers are recommended only as part of a multicomponent intervention and not as a single measure** [10-12]. Single interventions, such as using air purifiers alone, are not as effective as combining multiple approaches [13].
