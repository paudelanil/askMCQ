    "model_reasoning": "For patients with stable ischemic heart disease (SIHD) who are undergoing elective noncardiac surgery, the guidelines recommend continuing aspirin while discontinuing the P2Y12 inhibitor (in this case, clopidogrel) 5 days prior to the surgery. This approach helps to balance the risks of bleeding and thrombotic events. Continuing both medications could increase the risk of bleeding during the surgery, while stopping both could lead to thrombotic events. Therefore, the best management for the patient's antiplatelet therapy in preparation for cataract surgery is to continue aspirin and stop clopidogrel 5 days prior to the surgery.",

Stopping both medications could lead to thrombotic events. Continuing both medications increases the bleeding risk.",
