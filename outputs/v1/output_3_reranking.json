    "correct_answer_text": "Continue aspirin and stop clopidogrel 5 days prior to surgery.",
    "correct_answer_idx": 2.0,
    "model_reasoning": "The context specifies that for patients with stable ischemic heart disease undergoing elective noncardiac surgery, it is recommended to continue aspirin and discontinue the P2Y12 inhibitor (clopidogrel) 5 days prior to surgery. This aligns with the correct answer option, which states to \"Continue aspirin and stop clopidogrel 5 days prior to surgery.\" The other options either suggest stopping both medications or continuing both, which could lead to increased bleeding risk or thrombotic events, contrary to the guidelines mentioned in the context.",
    "reasoning_ground_truth": "For patients with stable ischemic heart disease who are undergoing elective noncardiac surgery, guidelines recommend to continue aspirin and to stop the P2Y12 inhibitor, (clopidogrel) 5 days before surgery to balance the risks of bleeding and thrombotic events. Stopping both medications could lead to thrombotic events. Continuing both medications increases the bleeding risk.",
