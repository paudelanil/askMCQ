The protocol allowed a repeat dose if the seizure continued after 4 minutes (for a maximum lorazepam dose of 4 mg and diazepam dose of 10 mg). For this study, status epilepticus was defined as continuous or repeated seizure for >5 minutes\nThe following conclusions were drawn. In adults, IM midazolam, IV lorazepam, IV diazepam (with or without phenytoin), and IV phenobarbital are established as efficacious at stopping seizures lasting at least 5 minutes (level A). Intramuscular midazolam has superior effectiveness compared with IV lorazepam in adults with convulsive status epilepticus without established IV access (level A).

Overt status epilepticus was defined as a continuous GTC seizure lasting 10 minutes or longer, or two or more GTC seizures without full recovery of consciousness.

Since the majority of seizures are brief, and once a seizure lasts more than 5 minutes it is likely to be prolonged (3), status treatment protocols have used a 5-minute definition to minimize both the risk of seizures reaching 30 minutes and the adverse outcomes associated with needlessly intervening on brief, self-limited seizures (2, 4).
