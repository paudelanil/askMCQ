      "Travel to elevations above 2500 m is associated with risk of developing one or more forms of acute altitude illness: acute mountain sickness (AMS), high altitude cerebral edema (HACE), and high altitude pulmonary edema (HAPE). Because large numbers of people travel to such elevations, many clinicians are faced with questions from patients about the best means to prevent these disorders. In addition, healthcare providers working at facilities in high altitude regions or as part of expeditions traveling to such areas can expect to see persons who are suffering from these illnesses and must be familiar with prophylactic regimens and proper treatment protocols.\n",

      "# Defining the Threshold for High Altitude and Where to Apply These Guidelines\n",
      "\n",
      "There is a risk of high altitude illness when unacclimatized individuals ascend to more than 2500 m. Prior studies and extensive clinical experience, however, suggest that susceptible individuals can develop AMS, and potentially HAPE, at elevations as low as 2000 m.2–4 Part of the difficulty of defining a specific threshold at which altitude illness can develop is the fact that the symptoms and signs of AMS, the most common form of altitude illness, are highly nonspecific, as demonstrated in several studies in which subjects met criteria for the diagnosis of AMS despite no gain in altitude.5–7 As a result, studies assessing AMS incidence at modest elevations may label individuals as having altitude illness when, in fact, symptoms are related to some other process, thereby falsely elevating the incidence of the disease at that elevation.\n",
      "\n",
      "Recognizing the difficulty in defining a clear threshold, the expert panel recommends an approach to preventing and treating acute altitude illness that does not depend strictly on the altitude to which an individual is traveling. Altitude illness is more common above 2500 m but can be seen at lower elevations. As a result, preventive measures should be considered not only based on the altitude to which the individual is traveling but should also take into account factors such as the prior history of performance at high altitude, rate of ascent, and availability of rest days for acclimatization (described in greater detail below). Similarly, the diagnoses of AMS, HAPE, or HACE should not be excluded simply based on the fact that an individual is ill below 2500 m. They should be strongly considered in the presence of compatible clinical features with careful attempts to exclude other entities such as severe dehydration, hyponatremia, pneumonia, or hypoglycemia, which may present in a similar manner.\n",

Acetazolamide and dexamethasone should be started the day before ascent (but will still have beneficial effects if started on the day of ascent). For individuals ascending to and staying at the same elevation for more than several days, prophylaxis may be stopped after 2 days at the target altitude. Individuals ascending faster than the recommended ascent rates should continue prophylaxis for a total of 4 days after arrival at the target altitude. Recommendation Grade: 2C.

      "Care should be taken to exclude disorders whose symptoms and signs may resemble those seen in AMS and HACE, such as dehydration, exhaustion, hypoglycemia, hypothermia, or hyponatremia.8 Persons with altitude illness of any severity should stop ascending and may need to consider descent depending on the clinical circumstances and severity of illness (Table 3).8 Patients with AMS can remain at their current altitude and use nonopiate analgesics for headache and antiemetics for gastrointestinal symptom relief; that may be all that is required. Acetazolamide will help treat AMS by facilitating acclimatization through increased ventilation and diuresis, but these physiologic effects may work better for prevention than for treatment. Although acetazolamide is good for treating mild illness, experienced clinicians have found dexamethasone a more reliably effective treatment for moderate-to-severe disease, which often requires descent as well. Individuals with AMS may resume their ascent once symptoms resolve, but further ascent or reascent to a previously attained altitude should never be undertaken in the face of ongoing symptoms. After resolution of AMS, reascent with acetazolamide is prudent.\n",

      "doses) was also shown to prevent HAPE in susceptible individuals. The mechanism for this effect is not clear, and there is very little, if any, clinical experience using dexamethasone for this purpose. Further data are necessary to validate this result. Recommendation Grade: 1C.\n",
      "\n",
      "# Acetazolamide\n",
      "\n",
      "Because acetazolamide hastens acclimatization, it should be effective at preventing all forms of acute altitude illness. It has been shown to blunt hypoxic pulmonary vasoconstriction in animal models and in a single study in humans, but there are no data specifically supporting a role in HAPE prevention. Clinical observations suggest acetazolamide may prevent reentry HAPE, a disorder seen in children who reside at high altitude, travel to lower elevation, and then develop HAPE upon rapid return to their residence. Recommendation Grade: 2C.\n",
      "\n",
      "# Preacclimatization and staged ascent\n",
      "\n",
      "No study has examined whether preacclimatization strategies are useful for HAPE prevention. Staged ascent, with 7 days of residence at moderate altitude (approximately 2200 m), has been shown to blunt the hypoxia-induced increase in pulmonary artery pressure, a key feature of the pathophysiology of HAPE. However, uncertainty remains as to the magnitude and duration of moderate altitude exposure necessary to yield benefit, and no study has specifically investigated whether the strategy is of benefit in known HAPE-susceptible individuals. Although the risks of preacclimatization and staged ascent are likely low, feasibility is a concern for many high altitude travelers. No specific recommendations regarding the appropriate preacclimatization or staging regimen can be made at this time. Recommendation Grade: 2C.\n",
      "\n",
      "# Suggested approach to HAPE prevention\n",
      "\n",
      "As noted earlier, because the physiologic responses to high altitude and rates of acclimatization vary considerably between individuals, the recommendations that follow, while generally effective, will not guarantee successful prevention in all high altitude travelers. A gradual ascent profile is the primary recommended method for preventing HAPE; the recommended ascent rate noted above for AMS and HACE prevention also applies with HAPE prevention. Drug prophylaxis should only be considered for individuals with a prior history of HAPE, especially multiple episodes, and nifedipine is the preferred option in such situations. It should be started the day before ascent and continued either until descent is initiated or the individual has spent 4 days at the target elevation. The duration of use at the target elevation should be extended to 7 days if the individual ascended faster than recommended ascent rates. Recommendation Grade: 2C. For individuals ascending to a high point and then descending toward the trailhead (e.g., descending from the summit of Kilimanjaro), prophylactic medications should be stopped once descent is initiated. Further research is needed before tadalafil or dexamethasone can be recommended for this purpose. Acetazolamide is a rational choice for HAPE prevention and clinical experience supports this, but data are lacking. Salmeterol should only be considered as a supplement to nifedipine in high-risk individuals with a clear history of recurrent HAPE.\n",

      "# TREATMENT\n",
      "\n",
      "Potential therapeutic options for HAPE include the following.\n",
      "\n",
      "# Descent\n",
      "\n",
      "As with AMS and HACE, descent remains the single best treatment for HAPE, but is not necessary in all circumstances. Individuals should try to descend at least 1000 m or until symptoms resolve. They should exert themselves as little as possible on descent (e.g., travel without a pack or via animal transportation) because exertion can further increase pulmonary artery pressure and exacerbate edema formation. Recommendation Grade: 1A.\n",
      "\n",
      "# Supplemental oxygen\n",
      "\n",
      "Oxygen delivered by nasal cannula or face mask at flow rates sufficient to achieve goal Sp O2 greater than 90% provides a suitable alternative to descent, particularly when patients can access healthcare facilities and be monitored closely. Recommendation Grade: 1B.\n",
      "\n",
      "# Portable hyperbaric chambers\n",
      "\n",
      "As with AMS and HACE, portable hyperbaric chambers can be used for HAPE treatment. They have not been systematically studied in this role, but their use in HAPE has been reported in the literature. Use of a portable hyperbaric chamber should not delay descent in situations in which descent is feasible. Recommendation Grade: 1B.\n",
      "\n",
      "# Nifedipine\n",
      "\n",

      "# WMS Practice Guidelines for Altitude Illness\n",
      "\n",
      "# Dexamethasone\n",
      "\n",
      "Considering its potential role in HAPE prevention, noted above, and studies demonstrating effects on maximum exercise capacity, pulmonary inflammation, and ion-transporter function in hypoxia, dexamethasone may have a role in HAPE treatment. Although reports document its clinical use in this regard, no study has established whether it is effective for this purpose. Recommendation Grade: 2C.\n",
      "\n",
      "# β-Agonists\n",
      "\n",
      "Although there are reports of β-agonist use in HAPE treatment, no data support a benefit from salmeterol or albuterol in patients suffering from HAPE. Recommendation Grade: 2C.\n",
      "\n",
      "# Suggested approach to HAPE treatment\n",
      "\n",
      "Before initiating treatment, care should be taken to rule out other causes of respiratory symptoms at high altitude, such as pneumonia, viral upper respiratory tract infection, mucus plugging, bronchospasm, or myocardial infarction. Descent is the first treatment priority in persons with HAPE. If descent cannot be initiated as a result of logistical factors, supplemental oxygen or a portable hyperbaric chamber should be used. Patients who have access to oxygen (eg, a hospital or high altitude medical clinic) may not need to descend to lower elevation and can be treated with oxygen at the current elevation. In the field setting, where resources are limited and there is a lower margin for error, nifedipine can be used as an adjunct to descent, oxygen, or portable hyperbaric therapy. It should only be used as primary therapy if none of these other measures is available. A phosphodiesterase inhibitor may be used if nifedipine is not available, but concurrent use of multiple pulmonary vasodilators is not recommended. In the hospital setting, CPAP can be considered as an adjunct to supplemental oxygen, and nifedipine can be added if patients fail to respond to oxygen therapy alone. In well-selected patients (adequate support from family or friends, adequate housing or lodging arrangements), it is feasible to discharge them from care with supplemental oxygen, rather than admitting them to a healthcare facility. There is no established role for acetazolamide, β-agonists, or diuretics in the treatment of HAPE.\n",
      "\n",
      "Individuals who develop HAPE may consider further ascent to higher altitudes or reascent to join their party only when symptoms of their disease have resolved and they maintain stable oxygenation at rest and with mild exercise while off supplemental oxygen or vasodilator therapy. Consideration may be given to using nifedipine or another pulmonary vasodilator on resuming ascent.\n",
      "\n",
      "# Diuretics\n",
      "\n",
      "Although their use has been documented in the literature, diuretics have no role in HAPE treatment, particularly because many HAPE patients have concurrent intravascular volume depletion. Recommendation Grade: 2C.\n",
      "\n",
      "# Suggested approach for patients with concurrent HAPE and HACE\n",
      "\n",
      "Dexamethasone should be added to the treatment regimen of patients with concurrent HAPE and HACE at the doses described above for those with HACE. Some patients with\n",
      "S12\n",
      "\n",
      "HAPE may have neurologic dysfunction caused by hypoxic encephalopathy rather than true HACE, but making the distinction between hypoxic encephalopathy and HACE in the field can be difficult, and as a result, dexamethasone should be added to the treatment regimen for HAPE patients with neurologic dysfunction that does not resolve rapidly with administration of supplemental oxygen and improvement in the patient’s oxygen saturation. Nifedipine or other pulmonary vasodilators may be used in patients with concurrent HAPE and HACE, but care should be exercised to avoid lowering mean arterial pressure, as this may decrease cerebral perfusion pressure and as a result increase the risk for cerebral ischemia.\n",

      "# Conclusions\n",
      "\n",
      "To assist practitioners caring for people planning travel to or already at high altitude, we have provided evidence-based guidelines for prevention and treatment of acute altitude illnesses, including the main prophylactic and therapeutic modalities for AMS, HACE, and HAPE, and recommendations regarding their role in disease management. Although these guidelines cover many of the important issues related to prevention and treatment of altitude illness, several important questions remain to be addressed and should serve as a focus for future research. Such research includes the optimal rate of ascent to prevent altitude illness, the role of acetazolamide in HAPE prevention and treatment, proper dosing regimens for prevention and treatment of altitude illness in the pediatric population, and the role of staged ascent and preacclimatization in altitude illness prevention.\n",

      "Content: There is a risk of high altitude illness when unacclimatized individuals ascend to more than 2500 m. Prior studies and extensive clinical experience, however, suggest that susceptible individuals can develop AMS, and potentially HAPE, at elevations as low as 2000 m.2–4 Part of the difficulty of defining a specific threshold at which altitude illness can develop is the fact that the symptoms and signs of AMS, the most common form of altitude illness, are highly nonspecific, as demonstrated in several studies in which subjects met criteria for the diagnosis of AMS despite no gain in altitude.5–7 As a result, studies assessing AMS incidence at modest elevations may label individuals as having altitude illness when, in fact, symptoms are related to some other process, thereby falsely elevating the incidence of the disease at that elevation.  \n",
      "Recognizing the difficulty in defining a clear threshold, the expert panel recommends an approach to preventing and treating acute altitude illness that does not depend strictly on the altitude to which an individual is traveling. Altitude illness is more common above 2500 m but can be seen at lower elevations. As a result, preventive measures should be considered not only based on the altitude to which the individual is traveling but should also take into account factors such as the prior history of performance at high altitude, rate of ascent, and availability of rest days for acclimatization (described in greater detail below). Similarly, the diagnoses of AMS, HAPE, or HACE should not be excluded simply based on the fact that an individual is ill below 2500 m. They should be strongly considered in the presence of compatible clinical features with careful attempts to exclude other entities such as severe dehydration, hyponatremia, pneumonia, or hypoglycemia, which may present in a similar manner.\n",

Acetazolamide will help treat AMS by facilitating acclimatization through increased ventilation and diuresis, but these physiologic effects may work better for prevention than for treatment. Although acetazolamide is good for treating mild illness, experienced clinicians have found dexamethasone a more reliably effective treatment for moderate-to-severe disease, which often requires descent as well.

A gradual ascent profile is the primary recommended method for preventing HAPE; the recommended ascent rate noted above for AMS and HACE prevention also applies with HAPE prevention. Drug prophylaxis should only be considered for individuals with a prior history of HAPE, especially multiple episodes, and nifedipine is the preferred option in such situations. It should be started the day before ascent and continued either until descent is initiated or the individual has spent 4 days at the target elevation. The duration of use at the target elevation should be extended to 7 days if the individual ascended faster than recommended ascent rates. Recommendation Grade: 2C. For individuals ascending to a high point and then descending toward the trailhead (e.g., descending from the summit of Kilimanjaro), prophylactic medications should be stopped once descent is initiated. Further research is needed before tadalafil or dexamethasone can be recommended for this purpose. Acetazolamide is a rational choice for HAPE prevention and clinical experience supports this, but data are lacking. Salmeterol should only be considered as a supplement to nifedipine in high-risk individuals with a clear history of recurrent HAPE.\n",

      "Content: As with AMS and HACE, descent remains the single best treatment for HAPE, but is not necessary in all circumstances. Individuals should try to descend at least 1000 m or until symptoms resolve. They should exert themselves as little as possible on descent (e.g., travel without a pack or via animal transportation) because exertion can further increase pulmonary artery pressure and exacerbate edema formation.

      "=====================\n",
      "Content: Before initiating treatment, care should be taken to rule out other causes of respiratory symptoms at high altitude, such as pneumonia, viral upper respiratory tract infection, mucus plugging, bronchospasm, or myocardial infarction. Descent is the first treatment priority in persons with HAPE. If descent cannot be initiated as a result of logistical factors, supplemental oxygen or a portable hyperbaric chamber should be used. Patients who have access to oxygen (eg, a hospital or high altitude medical clinic) may not need to descend to lower elevation and can be treated with oxygen at the current elevation. In the field setting, where resources are limited and there is a lower margin for error, nifedipine can be used as an adjunct to descent, oxygen, or portable hyperbaric therapy. It should only be used as primary therapy if none of these other measures is available. A phosphodiesterase inhibitor may be used if nifedipine is not available, but concurrent use of multiple pulmonary vasodilators is not recommended. In the hospital setting, CPAP can be considered as an adjunct to supplemental oxygen, and nifedipine can be added if patients fail to respond to oxygen therapy alone. In well-selected patients (adequate support from family or friends, adequate housing or lodging arrangements), it is feasible to discharge them from care with supplemental oxygen, rather than admitting them to a healthcare facility. There is no established role for acetazolamide, β-agonists, or diuretics in the treatment of HAPE.  \n",
      "Individuals who develop HAPE may consider further ascent to higher altitudes or reascent to join their party only when symptoms of their disease have resolved and they maintain stable oxygenation at rest and with mild exercise while off supplemental oxygen or vasodilator therapy. Consideration may be given to using nifedipine or another pulmonary vasodilator on resuming ascent.\n",

Nifedipine or other pulmonary vasodilators may be used in patients with concurrent HAPE and HACE, but care should be exercised to avoid lowering mean arterial pressure, as this may decrease cerebral perfusion pressure and as a result increase the risk for cerebral ischemia.\n",

      "Retrieved Context for Question: A 45-year-old patient, Ms. Roberts, presents with a history of moderate persistent asthma. She has been on medium-dose inhaled corticosteroids (ICS) and a long-acting beta2-agonist (LABA) for the past year. Her symptoms are well controlled most of the time, but she experiences worsening symptoms during seasonal changes. She is interested in learning about additional measures to reduce seasonal exacerbations. Ms. Roberts has no history of smoking, and spirometry shows moderate obstruction with significant reversibility. Allergy testing reveals sensitization to dust mites and pollen. What would be the most appropriate next step in her management to address her seasonal exacerbations?\n",
