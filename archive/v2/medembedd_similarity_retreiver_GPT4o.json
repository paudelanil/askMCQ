In balancing the lack of evidence supporting routine sputum culture with the desire for improved antimicrobial stewardship, the committee voted to continue the stance of previous guidelines in recommending neither for nor against routinely obtaining sputum Gram stain and culture in all adults with CAP managed in the hospital setting. Whether to culture patients or not should be determined by individual clinicians on the basis of clinical presentation, local\nThe 2007 IDSA/ATS CAP guidelines recommended a set of two major and nine minor criteria to define severe pneumonia requiring ICU admission (Table 1). These criteria were based on empirical evidence from published studies and expert consensus.

Several groups have validated these criteria in pneumonia cohorts from different countries (57\u201359, 61), with a meta-analysis reporting one\nOur recommendation to use the PSI as an adjunct to clinical judgment to guide the initial site of treatment is based on consistent evidence of the effectiveness and safety of this approach.

Cystatin C is an alternative endogenous filtration marker that is now increasingly available. Its assay can be put on autoanalyzers, and therefore its utilization could be increased with clinical demand. eGFRcr-cys provides the most accurate estimate and is recommended as the primary supportive test for people in whom there are concerns about eGFRcr\nIn this section, we describe the overall approach for the evaluation of GFR. As in the previous KDIGO Clinical Practice Guideline for the Evaluation and Management of Chronic Kidney Disease, the first method to evaluate GFR should be eGFRcr. If necessary for greater accuracy, the approach then recommends subsequent supportive tests from either the more accurate eGFRcr-cys or measurement of GFR using urinary or plasma clearance of exogenous filtration markers. In contrast to the previous",

A small number of randomized trials address the appropriate duration of antibiotic therapy in CAP, and randomized placebo-controlled trials of high quality are mostly limited to the inpatient setting. In these trials, no difference was observed between 5 additional days of oral amoxicillin compared with placebo in patients who had clinically improved on 3 days of intravenous amoxicillin (194), or between 2 days of intravenous cefuroxime followed by 5 days versus 8 days\nRecommendation. We recommend that the duration of antibiotic therapy should be guided by a validated measure of clinical stability (resolution of vital sign abnormalities [heart rate, respiratory rate, blood pressure, oxygen saturation, and temperature], ability to eat, and normal mentation), and antibiotic therapy should be continued until the patient achieves stability and for no less than a total of 5 days (strong recommendation, moderate quality of evidence).\nAs recent data supporting antibiotic administration for ,5 days are scant, on a risk\u2013benefit basis we recommend treating for a minimum of 5 days, even if the patient has reached clinical stability before 5 days.

Objective confirmation of a diagnosis of CRS|The clinician should confirm a clinical diagnosis of CRS with objective documentation of sinonasal inflammation, which may be accomplished using anterior rhinoscopy, nasal endoscopy, or computed tomography.|\nA systematic review assessed the diagnostic value of nasal endoscopy for adults with suspected CRS, using CT imaging as the gold standard for diagnostic certainty. Compared with baseline risk for CRS, a positive nasal endoscopy (pus or polyps) had an added value for confirming CRS of 25% to 28%, and a negative nasal endoscopy had an added value for ruling out CRS of 5% to 30%. The authors concluded that nasal endoscopy should be a first-line confirmatory test for CRS, reserving CT scanning for",
