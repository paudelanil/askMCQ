    "model_reasoning": "The context states that for patients with stable ischemic heart disease (SIHD) undergoing elective noncardiac surgery, it is recommended to continue aspirin and discontinue the P2Y12 inhibitor (clopidogrel) 5 days prior to surgery. This aligns with option C, which suggests continuing aspirin and stopping clopidogrel 5 days before surgery, thus balancing the risks of bleeding and thrombotic events.",
    "reasoning_ground_truth": "For patients with stable ischemic heart disease who are undergoing elective noncardiac surgery, guidelines recommend to continue aspirin and to stop the P2Y12 inhibitor, (clopidogrel) 5 days before surgery to balance the risks of bleeding and thrombotic events. Stopping both medications could lead to thrombotic events. Continuing both medications increases the bleeding risk.",
